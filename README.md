# Bank System Project

A simple banking system built in C++ to practice object-oriented programming and file handling.

## What Does It Do?

- Create bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Check account balance
- Store client information in a text file

## Files

- `Bank_system.cpp` - Main program
- `MyLibrary.h` - Helper functions
- `Clients.txt` - Stores client data

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kareem19mohamed/bank-project-prototype.git
   ```

2. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ Bank_system.cpp -o bank_system
   ```

3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./bank_system
   ```

## How to Use

Just follow the menu in the console to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check balances.

## What I Learned

This project helped me practice:
- Working with structs and arrays
- File input/output
- Basic menu systems
- String handling in C++

## Future Ideas

- Add login system
- Better data storage (database instead of text file)
- Show transaction history
- Make a nice UI
